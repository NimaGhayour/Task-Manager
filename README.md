# Task Manager (Vanilla JS Practice)

A lightweight, functional Task Management application built during the early stages of my web development journey to practice DOM manipulation and API integration.

## Features
* **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks seamlessly.
* **Status Management:** Organize tasks into four categories: *To do*, *In progress*, *Closed*, and *Frozen*.
* **Search & Filter:** Search tasks by title or filter them based on priority levels (High, Medium, Low).
* **Live API:** Integrated with MockAPI to persist data across sessions.
* **Responsive UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a mobile-friendly experience.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS.
* **Scripting:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Backend/API:** MockAPI (RESTful API).

## Reflection & Future Improvements
This project was a key milestone in understanding asynchronous JavaScript (`async/await`) and handling complex UI states without a framework. 

If I were to rebuild this project today, I would:
1.  **Migrate to TypeScript:** To implement strict typing for task objects and prevent runtime errors.
2.  **Add Drag-and-Drop:** Enhance the UX by allowing users to move tasks between columns visually.
3.  **Local Storage Fallback:** Implement local storage to ensure the app remains functional even if the API is offline.
4.  **Component-Based Architecture:** Use a library like React or Vue for better scalability and cleaner code.
